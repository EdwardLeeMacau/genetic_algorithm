# NTUEE - Genetic Algorithm 

## Abstract

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a method of optimizing a problem, inspired by the evolution in nature (**Selection**, **Crossover**, **Mutation**).

GA is commonly used in searching optimization solution in a difficult problem (for example: non-convex). 

For SimpleGA, it's a blackbox optimization method. Without the prior knowledge of the problem, using evolution to approximate a optimize solution.
